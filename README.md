# JumpWave
Jump Wave is a rhythm-based experimental mini–game built with the Godot Engine and written entirely in GDScript.
You are a pianist trapped inside an orange cube, and the only way to survive is by playing your notes — literally.

Numbers 1 to 8 represent your Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si, Do notes. Each note triggers a jump, a movement, or a musical reaction.
Use your piano keys to dodge obstacles, play melodies, and discover unexpected surprises hidden inside the rhythm.

Whether you're trying to survive the waves or simply want to perform your favorite tune, Jump Wave turns the keyboard into a living piano playground.

# Rhythm & Theme

Jump Wave blends simple platforming with musical input.
Your jumps are your notes, your notes are your movements, and the obstacles move in wave–like patterns that feel like a chaotic sheet of music.

Everything you press makes a sound.
Everything you survive adds to the rhythm.
